That's an excellent approach. To successfully implement Terraform Cloud in a large, scattered company, you need to treat it as an organizational change project, not just a technical one. The key is gathering the right scoping information to design a robust Organization/Workspace structure and establish clear Governance.

Here is a structured plan outlining what you need to know and gather from your directors, organized by area of focus.
 
üèõÔ∏è Organizational Structure & Governance
The goal is to map your physical organization to your Terraform Cloud organization, teams, and projects.

Area	Key Information to Gather	Terraform Cloud Impact
Teams & Business Units	1. Full Inventory of Teams: Get a list of all teams that own or will own infrastructure (Application Teams, Platform Teams, SRE, Networking, Security, Data).	Defines Teams and Users in TFC and how they'll collaborate/share access.
2. Org Unit/Cost Center Map: Which business units or cost centers map to which teams?	Essential for setting up Cost Estimation and Billing Tags in your cloud provider, often passed as a TFC variable.
3. Existing Change Management: What is the current process for approving infrastructure changes (e.g., Jira/ServiceNow process, approval gates)?	Defines Run Workflow and Sentinel Policy requirements for mandatory approval steps.
Ownership Model	4. Centralized vs. Decentralized: Will a central Platform Team manage all Terraform, or will App Teams manage their own modules?	Determines the Project/Workspace structure and who gets Admin vs. Read permissions.
üíª Infrastructure & Code Strategy
This information dictates how you'll structure your repositories and TFC workspaces.

Area	Key Information to Gather	Terraform Cloud Impact
Existing Infrastructure	1. Cloud Providers: Which cloud environments are in use (AWS, Azure, GCP, VMware, etc.)?	Directly impacts which Providers and Variables you configure in TFC.
2. Environment Topology: A clear map of environments (Dev, Test, Stage, Prod) across all clouds.	Defines the Naming Convention for your TFC Workspaces (e.g., app-a-prod, app-b-dev).
Current Code Setup	3. Existing Repositories: Which repos are already set up (you mentioned some exist)? Where are they (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)?	Determines the VCS Connection in TFC and how Workspaces are linked to code.
4. Module Strategy: Are there existing reusable modules? Is there a plan for a Private Module Registry?	Impacts the initial population of your TFC Private Registry and the plan for module contribution/maintenance.
Application Boundaries	5. Key Applications/Services: A list of the core applications and services and their critical infrastructure dependencies.	Helps determine the Blast Radius‚Äîyou may want a separate TFC Workspace for each critical application/environment to isolate state.
üåê Network & Data Platform
These areas represent high-volatility, high-governance infrastructure that should typically be managed separately.

Area	Key Information to Gather	Terraform Cloud Impact
Networking Topology	1. Network Ownership: Which team owns the core network components (VPCs/VNETs, VPNs, Interconnects, Firewall Rules, DNS)?	Network components should be managed in their own, highly-restricted TFC Workspaces (often called "Platform" or "Network" workspaces).
2. Shared Services: Are there shared security, logging, or monitoring services that all applications depend on?	These shared components should also have dedicated TFC Workspaces, with outputs shared via Remote State data sources.
Data Platform	3. Data Platform Inventory: List of critical databases, data lakes, and streaming services (e.g., RDS, Snowflake, Kafka).	These often require their own separate TFC Workspaces due to their high volatility and risk (a DB deletion has a massive impact).
üí° Recommended Organization Plan
Given a large, scattered company, a common and effective TFC organization strategy is:

Terraform Cloud Organization: One central TFC organization for the entire company.

TFC Projects: Group Workspaces by Business Unit or Major Infrastructure Layer (e.g., "Finance," "Marketing," "Global Network").

TFC Workspaces: Structure your workspaces by Application and Environment to separate state files and minimize the blast radius.

Level	Recommended Structure	Example
Organization	One per Company (e.g., my-corp-iac)	Enforces a single governance layer.
Project	Group by BU / Core Layer	Finance-Apps, Global-Network, Platform-Services
Workspace	Group by App / Environment	finance-billing-prod, marketing-website-dev, shared-logging-stage
This plan allows you to assign granular permissions to teams at the Project level, simplifying access control while maintaining a single platform for all infrastructure-as-code.

Would you like to focus on designing the TFC Project and Workspace structure or developing a plan for governance and security (Sentinel policies) first?

Structure assume they want maximum isolation but maximum shared modules. Many teams will write configurations but most terraform will be small group

That's a very common and effective pattern for large enterprises. The key is to implement a Hub-and-Spoke model within your Terraform Cloud (TFC) organization structure to achieve maximum isolation for infrastructure states while enabling maximum sharing of reusable code (modules).

Here is the recommended structure and separation of duties.

üèóÔ∏è Recommended Structure: Hub-and-Spoke Model
You should use a single TFC Organization but clearly separate your infrastructure into two key categories using TFC Projects: the centralized Platform (Hub) and the decentralized Applications (Spokes).

1. The Hub: Platform/Core Project
This is where the small central group of Terraform experts (the Platform Team) operates.

Component	Responsibility	Isolation Strategy	TFC Artifacts
Shared Services	Manages foundational, non-volatile infrastructure.	Dedicated TFC Workspaces (e.g., core-network-prod, iam-roles-stage). State is isolated from App teams.	Workspaces with high access restrictions.
Module Registry	Maintains and governs all reusable Terraform code.	TFC Private Module Registry is the single source of truth. Strict review process for module submission.	Modules tagged and versioned in the Registry.
Governance	Enforces policies, standards, and naming conventions.	Sentinel Policies are attached to Workspaces in the Application Projects.	Policy Sets applied organization-wide or per Project.
2. The Spokes: Application Projects
These are your isolated Business Units or Application Teams.

Component	Responsibility	Isolation Strategy	TFC Artifacts
Application Infra	Manages application-specific infrastructure (compute, databases, S3 buckets, etc.).	TFC Workspaces grouped by Application and Environment (e.g., finance-billing-prod). Each App team only has access to its own state.	Workspaces grouped into TFC Projects (e.g., Finance Project, Marketing Project).
Configuration	Teams write the root-level configurations (main.tf) that call the shared modules.	VCS Repositories for configurations are separate per application, reducing collaboration friction.	Configuration Files using source from the Private Registry.
üîë Key Mechanisms for Isolation and Sharing
Maximum Isolation (State)
To ensure teams cannot accidentally or maliciously affect others' infrastructure:

Workspace Granularity: Create the smallest possible Workspaces, typically one per application/service per environment (e.g., app-x-dev, app-x-stage, app-y-dev). This minimizes the blast radius of any single terraform apply.

Project Permissions: Use TFC Projects to enforce isolation. Grant a team (e.g., "Finance Team") access only to the Workspaces within their "Finance" TFC Project. They will be Blind to Workspaces in the "Marketing" Project.

VCS Separation: Link each TFC Workspace to a dedicated Git repository or folder path. This ties the run environment directly to the team's code ownership.

Maximum Sharing (Code)
To ensure configurations are consistent and leverage the central team's expertise:

Private Module Registry: Mandate that all infrastructure resources (VPCs, databases, secure buckets) are provisioned only using modules published to the TFC Private Module Registry. This is the core of sharing and governance.

Remote State Data: The Application Workspaces get network IDs, security group IDs, and other shared values from the Platform Workspaces using the terraform_remote_state data source.

Application Workspace‚Üídata "terraform_remote_state" ‚ÜíPlatform Network Workspace
This decouples the App teams from managing the core network, but gives them the necessary references to deploy into it.

üîí Director-Level Governance and Policy
For the directors, the governance layer is crucial:

Goal	TFC Tool	Policy Implemented
Security/Compliance	Sentinel Policy	Block creation of public S3 buckets, mandate encryption, enforce approved instance types.
Cost Control	Cost Estimation/Tags	Enforce mandatory CostCenter and BusinessUnit tags on all resources before a plan can proceed.
Consistency	Private Module Registry	Application teams must use the approved aws_vpc module from the registry instead of writing their own.
